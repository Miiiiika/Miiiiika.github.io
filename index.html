			<p style="position:relative; top: -5px;">Hello! My name is Mika, or JJ if you know me in real life. I use he/him pronouns. I was born in Boston, and now live in Tucson, Arizona. I made this website because I wanted to mess around with coding a bit. I like playing videogames, instruments like the guitar, movies, music, and most forms of art in general. The weirder the art, the better. If you find me online, you probably know me by one of these two profile pictures I use often. The one on the left is the character ENA, created by Joel G, and the one on the right is the character Jon, created by an artist on Instagram named Sawah_Draws. I highly recommend you check both of them out! You can navigate around the website using, if it's working right, the nifty bar on the top. Look at how the icons change when you hover over them! Wow! This page has some information about myself, Cool Things has a bunch of media recommendations, Cool Photos has art and pictures I've made, and Social Links has where you can contact me.</p>
