			<p style="position:relative; top: -5px;">Hello! My name is Mika, or JJ if you know me in real life. I use he/him pronouns. This page has some information about myself, Cool Things has a bunch of media recommendations, Cool Photos has art and pictures I've made, and Social Links has where you can contact me. I was born in Boston, and now live in Tucson, Arizona. I made this website because I wanted to mess around with coding a bit, challenge myself, and make something from scratch. I like playing videogames, instruments like the guitar, movies, music, and most forms of art in general. The weirder the art, the better. If you find me online, you probably know me by the profile picture I use to the right. It's a drawing by the artist Sawah_Draws, who is one of my favorite artists, I recommend checking out her art on instagram. You can navigate around the website using, if it's working right, the nifty bar on the top. Look at how the icons change when you hover over them! Wow!</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Did paid research work for the videogame <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1679290/Fire__Maneuver/">Fire and Maneuver</a>.
				<li>I've done some school-related academic things that I'm also pretty proud of. Once I get around to it, you'll be able to find some of those papers on this website if you're bored enough to read those.</li>
				<li>Self-taught coding and built this website B^)</li>
				<li>I've also done other things with coding, like building some simple mods for games such as Hearts of Iron IV.
				<li>I have built some board games from scratch, mostly ones focused on historical moements. You can read more about them in Cool Things once I get around to building it.</li>
				<li>I spent 2 years studying abroad in England during Highschool. It was pretty cool.</li>
				<li>I can play the guitar pretty well, and I know a little bit of ukelele and banjo too!</li>

		<h3 style="text-align:center">Why did you make this?</h3>
		<p>I made this website, and continue to update and remake it, for a couple reasons. The first, and perhaps most important reason, is that I am bored. There are a few other and more pretentious reasons though. One reason is that I think this is MUCH cooler of a way to present myself than some twitter or instagram page. I can be much more creative with this and also show off. Also, I wanted to build something from scratch and be a little bit creative. I think that it's very easy to just consume content that others make, and I got very used to only doing that, rather than really making something that was my own. By building this website from scratch I get to not only challenge myself to get better at coding, but also challenge myself to be more creative and open. The most difficult part of making this wasn't the coding most of the time, but coming up with things I'd like to put in all these boxes. Basically, I want to do something that makes me grow creatively, and this is a fun way to do that.</p>
