	<h2>Cool Things I Like</h2>

			<h2>Movies</h2>
			<p>Movies have been important to me for all of my life. The types of movies I like tend to be ones that are experiemental or otherwise weird in nature. They also tend to be slower paced. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
			<h4>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h4>
			<p>This is a contender for my favorite movie of all time. It follows the story of a young man named Zero, a migrant from a distant country, who finds work at the Grand Budapest Hotel in a fictional vaguely eastern-European country. I love it for its story, which manages to be both funny, heartfelt, and sad at the same time. The cinematic style is also great. I also absolutely adore its soundtrack.</p>
			<h4>BARDO: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths</h4>
			<p>This movie is a sort-of autobiography directed by Alejandro Inarritu, who is a director from Mexico famous for other movies like Birdman and The Revenant. It is, as the title implies, somewhat falseified, or exaggerated to feel like a more emotional experience. It feels like the movie version of a stream-of-consciousness book. I like it for its emotional storytelling, its masterfully written dialogue, its cinematic style, and I absolutely love the way the ending ties right back in to the beginning of the movie.</p>
			<h4>The Revenant</h4>
			<p>Made by the same director as BARDO, this film follows an American fur-trader and his mixed-race son across the brutal landscape of the American fur trade in the 1840s. The film has amazing cinematography and an equally good soundtrack. The violence in the movie is also particularly well choreographed. </p>
			<h4>Come and See</h4>
			<p>This movie was made in the Soviet Union in the 1980s by a director who had lived through the Nazi invasion during the '40s. The movie follows a young boy, Flyora, who joins a partisan group behind enemy lined in occupied Belarus. The movie is very difficult to watch, but I think it is important for that very reason. I have not seen any other movies that so accurately portray the horrors of war, and of the Nazi's invasion in paricular. I wouldn't watch this if you don't want to feel some absolute despair.</p>
			<h4>The Lord of the Rings</h4>
			<p>LOTR was one of the most formational series' I watched during my childhood. The Fellowship of the Ring especially is one of, in my opinion, the best movies ever made. The soundtrack especially always gets to me. If you like fantasy and somehow haven't watched this series, I can't recommend it enough.</p>
			<h4>Cmon Cmon</h4>
			<p>This movie stars Joaquin Pheonix as a man who finds purpose in his life by caring for his 8 year old nephew. It is extremely heartfelt, and really just a very calm and sweet movie. The soundtrack is also very nice.</p>
